## Task

Design a **multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** that can:
1. **Ingest**, index, and retrieve information from *AI policy documents* (OECD, EU, UN, NTIA, etc.),
2. **Analyze and debate** governance trade-offs (transparency, risk, privacy, accountability),
3. **Verify and summarize** outcomes using autonomous agents,
4. **Produce an explainable, auditable policy brief** grounded in cited sources.

The system must combine **classical NLP**, **transformer embeddings**, and **agentic reasoning** within a reproducible GitHub repository.
